                p.story__description Recent surveys found zero numbers of axolotl in their native wetlands, which cover less than 4 square miles. Essentially, the animal is all but extinct in the wild. There are plenty of captive populations around the world, bred for pets or research, and the wetlands are undergoing restoration. But while the captives offer hope for reintroductions at some later point, they’re not ideal: every generation that breeds in captivity is a further step removed from its wild state, and is that much less likely to adjust to life in the wild. Therefore, plans to reintroduce axolotl hinge on genetic 'injections' from wild-caught individuals, should enough be found.

                p.story__description Ruma and Vali are a mother and son living at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Their true haunts are the last big tracts of moist forest in western – central Africa, home to perhaps three hundred thousand chimpanzees. They are like us in many ways: a diet that includes meat, greenery, honey, eggs; a near-monthly estrous cycle, with singletons or twins born; close families raising kids into their teens. A century ago there were a million, but today, chimpanzees suffer attrition as their forests are cut from beneath them; many are picked off for bushmeat on the fringes of logging camps, their orphaned infants taken as pets, rendered incapable of returning to the wild. Forest loss is intensifying under palm-oil production and mining (to supply the automobile and cellphone industries, for instance). National and international laws govern all chimps, right across their range, but are poorly enforced. Chimpanzees need protection – better, stricter, faster.
